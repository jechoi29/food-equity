		<h4>	We are a group of college students from the University of Washington who want to make a difference in other people's lives! 1 in every 13 people suffer from a food allergy, and malnutrition continues to infect people from all economic levels. Therefore we created Recipe Radar in order to
		help people find recipes that are good for their health and suitable for their dietary needs. Having recipes at the tip of your fingers
		encourages people to cook their own food, rather than buying unhealhy processed foods from fast-food chains.
		We want to ensure that everyone regardless of economic status can access healthy food, therefore we have extended our resources to
		food banks who can implement our Radar in their systems to help others find recipes with accessible ingredients.
